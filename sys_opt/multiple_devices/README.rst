Multiple Devices (C)
====================

This example show how to take advantage of multiple FPGAs on a system. It will show how to initialized an OpenCL context, allocate memory on the two devices and execute a kernel on each FPGA.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** `OpenCL Host APIs <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/OpenCL-Programming>`__, Multi-FPGA Execution, `Event Handling <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Overlapping-Data-Transfers-with-Kernel-Computation>`__

**KEYWORDS:** xcl::get_xil_devices

**EXCLUDED PLATFORMS:** 

 - All NoDMA Platforms, i.e u50 nodma etc

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/vector_addition.cpp
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./multiple_devices <vector_addition XCLBIN1> <vector_addition XCLBIN2>

DETAILS
-------

This example demonstrates how multiple FPGA devices can be configured on
a system.

OpenCL context and queues are initialized for each FPGA.

.. code:: cpp

   contexts[d] =cl::Context(devices[d], props, nullptr, nullptr, &err);
   queues[d] = cl::CommandQueue(contexts[d], devices[d], CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE, &err);

Each FPGA device needs to be loaded and programmed with binary file and
a kernel each is created for FPGAs on the system.

.. code:: cpp

   fileBuf[d] = ((d=0) ? xcl::read_binary_file(binaryFile, fileBufSize) : xcl::read_binary_file(binaryFile2, fileBufSize));
   bins[d].push_back({fileBuf[d], fileBufSize});
   programs[d] = load_cl2_binary(bins[d], devices[d], contexts[d]);
   kernels[d] = cl::Kernel(programs[d], "vadd", &err);

Buffers are also created for each FPGA seperately.

.. code:: cpp

   buffer_a[d] = cl::Buffer(contexts[d], CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR | CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, size_per_device, &A[offset], &err);

Following table summarizes the observations while running the design on 1 and 2 U50 platforms:

============ =============
Device Count Time Taken(s) 
============ ============= 
1            47.41
2            23.71
Speedup      1.99
